## Requirements

* node >= 12.0.0

* `npm` and `yarn` installed

* Ensure [`cvwo-backend`]("https://github.com/polygonalr/cvwo-backend") is already deployed!

## Setting up development server

Installation is assumed to be done on a fresh copy of Ubuntu.

First, install the dependencices for this project.

```bash
yarn install
```

Configure `src/api/client.ts` with the endpoint of the API server. Then, run the development server.

```bash
yarn start
```

## Deployment

To create the optimised build of the app, run the following command.

```bash
yarn build
```

For quick deployment, we will be using `serve`. Install it with yarn.

```bash
yarn global add serve
```

Afterwards, serve the `build` directory generated by `yarn build`.

```bash
serve -s build
```

## Default permissions

| User             | Admin            |
|------------------|------------------|
| Create new tags  | Create new users |
| Create new tasks | Delete any tags  |
| Edit owned tasks | Edit any tasks   |
|                  | Delete any tasks |

## Areas for improvement

1) Docker deployment.

2) Use .ENV for configurations instead.

3) Many other small `// TODO`-s scattered around the codebase which are usually minor code cleanups or ui adjustments, that do not affect the functionality.
